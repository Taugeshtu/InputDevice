### Prototype
Datasheet: [[MUX_CD74HC4067.pdf]]
This is the breakout: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9056

This is weird... Datasheet specs that the EN pin is actually !EN; breakout board doesn't have an inverter - just a pull-down 10k resistor according to [schematic](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/BreakoutBoards/Analog-Digital-Mux-Breakout-v11.pdf)
